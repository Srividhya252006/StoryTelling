                    </h2>
                    <p>Every month, people earn and spend money, but many do not track where it goes. This project explores how individuals allocate their income across essential and discretionary categories like housing, food, transport, education, entertainment, healthcare, and savings. Understanding spending habits helps in financial planning, ensuring better budgeting and long-term stability. By analyzing these patterns, we can identify areas for optimization and smarter money management. A well-planned budget reduces financial stress and helps individuals achieve their financial goals.

                    </h2>
                    <p>  People with different income levels have distinct spending habits.

                        <h2>How Has Inflation Changed Our Spending?
                        </h2>
                        <p>Over time, inflation has raised the prices of essential goods and services, affecting how people allocate their income. As costs increase, individuals must adjust their budgets to manage rising expenses. Housing, food, and healthcare have become more expensive, impacting lower-income groups the most. Savings have declined for many as more income is spent on necessities. Transportation and utility costs have also risen, requiring financial adjustments. The line graph visually represents these trends, showing how different income groups respond to inflation.</p>

                    <h2> Do People Spend More on Weekends? </h2>
                    <p>saturday and Sunday have more high-spending outliers, likely due to weekend shopping, dining, and leisure activities.
                        Monday also has notable spending, possibly for rent, bills, and groceries at the start of the week.Wednesday sees fewer high-value transactions, indicating lower spending midweek.
                        Spending is more random on weekends, meaning not everyone follows the same patternâ€”some people spend a lot, while others keep it low.
                        Overall, weekend spending is higher for some individuals, particularly for discretionary expenses. However, spending habits vary, with some preferring to spend more during weekdays.
