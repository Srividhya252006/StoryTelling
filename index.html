                    <h2>Where Does Your Money Go? 
                    </h2>
                    <p>Every month, people earn and spend money, but many do not track where it goes. This project explores how individuals allocate their income across essential and discretionary categories like housing, food, transport, education, entertainment, healthcare, and savings. Understanding spending habits helps in financial planning, ensuring better budgeting and long-term stability. By analyzing these patterns, we can identify areas for optimization and smarter money management. A well-planned budget reduces financial stress and helps individuals achieve their financial goals.

                    <h2>Do Different Income Groups Spend Differently? 
                    </h2>
                    <p>  People with different income levels have distinct spending habits. Low-income earners prioritize essentials like housing, food, and utilities, with limited spending on savings and entertainment. Middle-income individuals balance necessities with discretionary expenses, allocating moderate amounts to savings and leisure. High-income earners have greater flexibility, spending significantly on savings, entertainment, and lifestyle choices. The bar chart visually compares these spending patterns, showing how financial priorities shift across income groups. Understanding these differences helps in financial planning and effective budgeting.

                    <h2>How Has Inflation Changed Our Spending?
                    </h2>
                    <p>Over time, inflation has raised the prices of essential goods and services, affecting how people allocate their income. As costs increase, individuals must adjust their budgets to manage rising expenses. Housing, food, and healthcare have become more expensive, impacting lower-income groups the most. Savings have declined for many as more income is spent on necessities. Transportation and utility costs have also risen, requiring financial adjustments. The line graph visually represents these trends, showing how different income groups respond to inflation.</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>Many people struggle to save the recommended 20% of their income due to rising living expenses. High-income earners save more than the suggested amount, allowing for better financial security. Middle-income earners often meet the savings recommendation but may face challenges with unexpected costs. Low-income earners save significantly less due to high essential expenses, making long-term financial stability difficult. The stacked bar chart visually compares actual vs. recommended savings across different income groups, highlighting gaps in financial planning.</p>
